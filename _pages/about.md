Hello! I'm Bo Peng, currently in my second year as a PhD student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am co-supervised by Prof. Yu Qiao and Dr. Chaochao Lu. My research is being conducted in collaboration with both Shanghai AI Lab and SJTU. At the moment, my goal is to develop efficient and effective methods for casual reasoning, enable automated AI scientists, and develop self-conscious agents. If you're interested in partnering on a project, welcome to reach out.
